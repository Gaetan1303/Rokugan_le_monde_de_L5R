# Documentation sources

This folder originally contained very large HTML files (L5A_4Ed_Fr-part-*.html) exceeding GitHub’s 100MB limit.

To keep the repo pushable:
- Those files are not tracked anymore
- They’re ignored by .gitignore

If you need them locally, store them here without committing, or use an external storage (e.g., OneDrive/Drive). For versioning big files, consider Git LFS.
